# Outreach Playbook — First Revenue

## Target Volume
- 40 highly personalized outbound touches/day
- Channels: X DM, Telegram founder contact, contact form, public business email

- Ask for async intake, not a meeting

## Template A (Founder DM)
"Hey {name} — quick note from ChainPulse Labs. We reviewed {protocol} and noticed a likely growth leak around {signal}. We run a 48-hour on-chain growth + tokenomics audit (fixed $1,200 USDC) and deliver a ranked execution plan your team can ship immediately. If useful, I can send the intake link."

## Template B (Email)
Subject: 48h growth audit for {protocol}

Fixed fee: $1,200 USDC.
If relevant, reply 'send intake' and we’ll proceed asynchronously."
